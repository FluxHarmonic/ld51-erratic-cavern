* Design

Since this is a top-down dungeon crawler, we need a grid-based map.  It doesn't require scrolling or any extent larger than the current screen (for now).

The tiles and walls will be the same size, something like 64x64.

** Every 10 Seconds

To comply with the theme of this compo, we will implement the 10 seconds behavior like so:

- The target item position will be changed to a new random location, somewhere that is passable on the map (or a specifically marked item location).  The position also must be some distance away from the player's current position so that it isn't inordinately easy to win.

** Ideas

- Every time an item is picked up an enemy appears in the map
- Once you pick up a certain set of items an exit appears
- Set of items is different on each level

* Development and Debugging

#+begin_src sh

  # To debug, run M-x gud-gdb with this command:
  guix shell --pure -m manifest.scm -- gdb --args bin/dev/erratic-cavern

#+end_src

* Tasks

** DONE Add item position randomization at the interval
CLOSED: [2022-10-02 Sun 09:30]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-10-02 Sun 09:30]
:END:

- [X] Keep a list of all valid item locations
- [X] Pick a new position for each item (ideally unique position for each item)
- [X] Make sure we don't pick the player position
- [X] Show a timer gauge at the bottom of the screen

** DONE Add configurable player start
CLOSED: [2022-10-02 Sun 09:42]

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-10-02 Sun 09:42]
:END:
** DONE Add patrols that have logic on step and also can be randomized at the interval
CLOSED: [2022-10-02 Sun 14:35]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-10-02 Sun 14:35]
