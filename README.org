* Design

Since this is a top-down dungeon crawler, we need a grid-based map.  It doesn't require scrolling or any extent larger than the current screen (for now).

The tiles and walls will be the same size, something like 64x64.

** Every 10 Seconds

To comply with the theme of this compo, we will implement the 10 seconds behavior like so:

- The target item position will be changed to a new random location, somewhere that is passable on the map (or a specifically marked item location).  The position also must be some distance away from the player's current position so that it isn't inordinately easy to win.

** Ideas

- Every time an item is picked up an enemy appears in the map
- Once you pick up a certain set of items an exit appears
- Set of items is different on each level

* Development and Debugging

#+begin_src sh

  # To debug, run M-x gud-gdb with this command:
  guix shell --pure -m manifest.scm -- gdb --args bin/dev/erratic-cavern

#+end_src

* Tasks

** TODO Add item position randomization at the interval
** TODO Fix the issue with item removal on pickup
** TODO Add entities that have logic on step and also can be randomized at the interval
** TODO Add configurable player start and item locations
** TODO Finish the first map
** TODO Add 2 more maps
** TODO Integrate classes and generic methods?
** TODO Implement a win and lose state (time limit)
** TODO Implement unlockable doors with key pickups
** TODO Implement traps that can end the game (maybe be disabled with an item?)
** TODO Make the window show up centered when it opens
